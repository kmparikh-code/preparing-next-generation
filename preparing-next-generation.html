            <p>But here's what keeps a lot of parents up at night: <strong>What happens when this wealth transfers to your kids?</strong></p>
            
            <div class="stat-highlight">
                <span class="number">72%</span>
                <span class="description">According to a <a href="https://www.citizensbank.com/learning/great-wealth-transfer-survey.aspx" target="_blank">2024 Citizens Bank survey of 1,500 Americans</a>, 72% don't feel confident in their ability to manage a financial windfall.</span>
            </div>

            <p>It's not because kids are irresponsible. It's because most families never prepare them.</p>

            <p>They assume kids will "figure it out" when the time comes. They worry that talking about money too early will ruin their work ethic. They fear the conversation will be awkward.</p>

            <p>So they wait. And often, they wait too long.</p>

            <p><strong>The truth:</strong> Preparing the next generation isn't about teaching them to manage a portfolio. It's about instilling values, building competence, and creating a shared understanding of what wealth means to your family.</p>

                    <div class="collapsible-content-inner">
                        <p>Most parents wait until their kids are in their 20s or 30s to start talking about family wealth. By then, you've already missed the most important years.</p>
                        
                        <p>The reality: Kids start forming beliefs about money around age 7. By their early teens, many of those beliefs are set.</p>
                        
                        <p>That doesn't mean you need to tell your 10-year-old about your net worth. But you do need to start teaching basic concepts: saving, delayed gratification, the difference between wants and needs, and most importantly, the values your family has around money.</p>
                        
                        <p>Waiting until they're adults means you're not teaching them - you're correcting them. And that's a much harder conversation.</p>
                        
                        <p>Start age-appropriate conversations early. Build on them as your kids grow. By the time they're ready to inherit, money won't be a mysterious or scary topic - it'll be something they've been learning about their entire lives.</p>

                        <p>A lot of families think they're "prepared" because they have an estate plan. Trusts are set up. Beneficiaries are named. Documents are signed.</p>
                        
                        <p>But an estate plan just tells the money where to go. It doesn't prepare your kids to receive it.</p>
                        
                        <p>Think about it this way: If you were handing your kids the keys to a car, you'd make sure they knew how to drive first, right? You wouldn't just throw them the keys and hope for the best.</p>
                        
                        <p>Wealth is the same way. The legal structure matters, but the preparation matters more.</p>
                        
                        <p>That means teaching them about investments, taxes, and cash flow management. Involving them in family financial discussions. Letting them make small financial decisions (and mistakes) while the stakes are low. Explaining the "why" behind your wealth transfer decisions.</p>
                        
                        <p>Your estate plan is step one. Your wealth education plan is step two. You need both.</p>

                        <p>You might think your kids don't notice how you handle money. But they do. Every single day.</p>
                        
                        <p>They watch how you tip at restaurants. How you talk about your job. Whether you stress about bills or feel confident. How you react when something breaks. Whether you comparison shop or impulse buy. How you handle unexpected expenses.</p>
                        
                        <p>They're absorbing lessons about money constantly - whether you're teaching them or not.</p>
                        
                        <p>And here's the thing: What they observe will shape them more than anything you say in a formal "money talk" years later.</p>
                        
                        <p>If you want your kids to be responsible with money, you can't just tell them to be responsible. You have to show them what that looks like. That means being intentional about the financial behaviors you're modeling - and occasionally narrating your thought process so they understand why you make the choices you do.</p>
                        
                        <p>The good news? You're already teaching them about money every day. The question is: What lessons are they learning?</p>
